5. There are three user types: Department Employee, Department Supervisor, Company Supervisor.
6. Tasks can be assigned to departments, but can also be assigned to individual employees.

8. As an additional requirement, we should be able to assign a role to a employee.
9. Tasks can have four types of status: Planned, Pending, Too Late, Done.
10. As an additional requirement, we would like to provide the product owner with a feedback system per task.
    - Here, employees can discuss the progress of the task.
    - We have not yet discussed this with the product owner.
11. Description of user types.
    - Employee, can view all tasks relevant for them, can check off tasks that they have access to.
    - Department Supervisor, can view and manage all tasks of the department. Can do everything the employee can do.
    - Company Supervisor, can view and manage all tasks of all departments. Can do everything the department supervisor can
      do.
12. One of the four departments should be a general department (tasks related to the whole company).
13. Supervisors should be able to add and edit tasks.

## Questions for the product owner

1. Can you only see the tasks for your department? Or do you also see other tasks.
2. Should we provide a google calendar import & export system? Might be out of scope / difficult?
3. Should we still provide some manual control over the system? Be able to overwrite the system?
